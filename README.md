# PET - PROJEKT

This project was started as a pet project and it is still in progress. It is a static webpage for now. This project aims to demonstrate my interest in new technoligies and responsive web design. The future aim is to allow animal shelters to register and upload their rescued animals for adoption with the help of this application.
